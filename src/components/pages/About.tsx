                    <p>
                         I'm Henrique Pochmann from Porto Alegre/RS - Brazil
                         (GMT-3). With over 20 years of experience creating,
                         developing, and participating in digital projects, and
                         also with solid experience in design, I recently found
                         my passion in front-end development. Currently, I'm
                         fine-tuning my skills to move software engineering to
                         the center of my professional life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Development aside, a few topics I am particularly
                         interested in are investments, learning languages,
                         music, and making pizza/burgers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Am I a good fit for your project? Feel free to drop me
